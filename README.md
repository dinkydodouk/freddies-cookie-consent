# Freddie's Cookie Consent plugin for Craft CMS 3.x

A cookie consent banner that blocks cookies before they are set. There are many banners out there that can give you a simple popup message, but this one blocks the Cookies before they start and you can enter your cookies into sections ready to be accepted or blocked. Not bad, huh?

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0-beta.23 or later.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Freddie's Cookie Consent.
